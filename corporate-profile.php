                          <p class="text-muted">PROFILES RH LLC was established with a workforce of nearly 20 employees.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">During its first year of full operation, the company rested its efforts within its Sales & Marketing, Research & Development, Quality Control & Quality Assurance managed by professionals from all across the Middle East and supported by a labour force from Southeast Asia.  </p>
                          <p class="text-muted">In the years that followed, the company continued to improve and preserve its position as a leader in its industry, adjusting to economic cycles and reconfigured playing fields through diversification, restructuring and reorganisation.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">Great concentration of efforts were placed in the sales, production, deliveries and collections divisions, creating what had later become the company’s credo to “Never Say No to a Customer Requirement”.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">In the beginning, the main products were polyurethane insulated sandwich panels used for roofing of warehouses.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">The market started demanding the secondary supports where the company had begun to manufacture and supply newer and better products, leading to more demand in primary supports, cold stores, refrigerated trucks, pre-painted metals.</p>

                          <p class="text-muted">In 1995, PROFILES had begun to position itself as a main contractor, capable of producing all the elements required for warehouses, including the civil works such as foundations, floorings, block walls, office areas, septic tanks, toilets, and interlocking tiles.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">The ever-more-precise specifications of our customers provided greater incentives for PROFILES to set up its own production of aluminum sheets used for roofing warehouses, as well as producing its own polyester paints, polyester polyols for the production of its polyurethane panels, powder coating lines, wet coating lines, water jets cutting lines, de-lacquering furnaces, revervatory melting furnaces, rotary furnaces, annealing furnaces, shredding equipment, and used beverage cans recycling lines.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">This move allowed for great return on investment (ROI) and in reducing the number of sub-contracted projects.  PROFILES invested heavily in resources to train its workforce to generate a competitive return on capital and to meet financial and stakeholder obligations.</p>
                          <p class="text-muted">Consequently, the company had experienced substantial growth, in addition to applying internationally recognised health, safety and environment regulations.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted">This aluminum rolling mill division manufactures aluminum coils for industrial use and polykraft-insulated aluminum coils for petrochemical companies earning the credentials as the first company outside the US to manufacture Insulated Aluminium Coils and profiles for the requirement of Petrochemical Industries through its own Research and Development.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">As a result of the success gained from its steel fabrication division, PROFILES’ capacity has increased from 9,000 tons per year (typ) to 20,000typ.  This expansion was commissioned in autumn of 2006 and cladding division’s plant capacity had doubled from its 3.3-million sqm a year to 6-million sqm a year.  </p>
