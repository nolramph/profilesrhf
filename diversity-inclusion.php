                        <p>Our company’s long history of success confirms that leaders in their industry play to their strengths.  At PROFILES RH, our greatest strength is our people.  We value the different ethnicities, beliefs and backgrounds brought forth by our employees who make our company great.  Today, with competition tightening for a talent pool that is increasingly diverse, we have formally established that conviction among our key core values, where we act on these principles to create an environment that embraces individual differences and encourages every employee to attain his or her full potential.</p>
                        <p>We are regularly implementing a people-based business imperative by playing to our strengths. We have enlisted the energy and intellect of our employees to help secure the world-class workforce that will follow in their footsteps.  Our diversity activities include a top-down training component to raise awareness and sharpen the skills needed to lead, manage and recruit a diverse workforce – led by a team of vibrant leaders.</p>
                        <p>The only challenge greater than attracting a diverse workforce is retaining it, and through an ever-more-inclusive way of operating our business by fostering a culture that values all of our people and their individual differences, our company is working diligently to keep the best on board.  Our commitment to diversity is communicated both through our actions and the words that brand our company.  Diversity drives success — for our company, for our colleagues, for our customers and for our communities worldwide.</p>
