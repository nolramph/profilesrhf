                    <h3>Energy Management</h3>
                    <p>Our company is highly motivated to reduce the amount of energy consumed in making steel and aluminum and to better understand the impact our operations may have on the emission of greenhouse gases. In addition to environmental concerns, there are compelling economic and national security reasons for attention to energy management.  Improving the energy efficiency of our processes is an ongoing focus of our operations. Incentives are in place to identify opportunities in the production line that will result in energy savings.  Recovery and reuse of energy to fuel other operations is also beneficial because that reduces overall consumption.  We have also increased our use of alternative fuels based on renewable resources.</p>

                <div class = "col-md-12">
                <p>Taking responsibility for the impact of our operations is fundamental to being a proactive corporate citizen. In the years ahead, our company will continue to examine and refine our processes to further conserve energy and other natural resources, reuse or recycle byproducts of production, whenever possible, and seek opportunities at every turn to exercise responsible stewardship over the environment we share with generations to come.</p>
